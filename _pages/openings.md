# Open positions
We are always looking for new group members who are excited about science and engineering! Since you will be joining a new lab (as I experienced personally during my postdoc), you will have the rewarding opportunity to shape both the lab culture and the research direction. You will be based in Toronto, a vibrant city with a strong [AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and [Quantum](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca) community.

The research in our group is highly interdisciplinary, and we welcome students with diverse backgrounds, including Electrical Engineering, Physics, and Computer Science. Projects in this lab are designed to have both experimental and theoretical components, so students with either background are encouraged to apply. If you are interested, please send me an email at t.onodera@utoronto.ca. Note that the application deadline for the academic year 2025 is **January 9, 2025**, please visit the [U of Toronto ECE department website](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/graduates/#apply-now) for application details.

Finally, we are always looking for highly motivated undergraduate students who would like to work on a project either for a summer internship or their thesis. Interested students are encouraged to send me an email at t.onodera@utoronto.ca, with a description of their background and interest.


<!-- **We are currently open for PhD and postdoc applications related to our ERC CoG grant. The positions are mostly related to the Electron Pair Microscopy projects.**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

We especially welcome postdocs with fellowships. I'd be happy to support you, also after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)). In many country, there are also fellowships available for outdoing postdocs.**


### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
